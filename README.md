# Horiseon-web-co

## Motivation 
- I created the project to practice adding semantic elements to the webpage to make it more accessible for people who may have disabilites. I learned about how semantic html elements help search engines determine the significance of the context on the webpage since it better defines the different sections and layout of the entire webpage.
